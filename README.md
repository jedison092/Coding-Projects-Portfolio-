# Jeremiah Edison’s FreeCodeCamp Projects

Welcome! This repository showcases the projects I completed as part of my journey through FreeCodeCamp’s web development curriculum. Each project was an opportunity not just to apply what I learned—but to make it my own.

- Responsive Web Design Projects  
- JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures  
- Front End Development Libraries

## 💡 How I Made These Projects My Own

Each project started with a FreeCodeCamp challenge prompt, but I went a step further by:

- Adding my own design styles and layouts
- Customizing color palettes, fonts, and animations
- Rewriting or restructuring code for better readability and performance
- Implementing additional features or interactivity
- Making sure each project reflects both my personality and growing skillset

## 🚀 Why This Matters

These projects represent more than practice—they’re proof of my creativity, dedication, and ability to learn fast and build with purpose. I’m excited to keep growing and applying these skills professionally.
